No sport is static. The NFL is no exception. Though through the last decade the NFL has undergone a transformation unlike any sport has seen in our lifetime. In 2008 teams averaged a paltry 3,380 passing yards a season. By 2019 they averaged 3,759. The top teams in the NFL can easily throw for nearly 5,000 yards a season. At the same time, rushing yards have stayed the same or even slightly declined. This project seeks to analyze the trends in the NFL to better understand the explosion of pass first offenses and draw preliminary conclusions about the future of NFL offenses.
